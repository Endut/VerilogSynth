# FPGA Synthesizer based on Direct Digital Synthesis
Synthesizer core written in Verilog.

Full project utilises an arduino to take in MIDI input and communicate with the synth core via SPI.

## TODO
+ Ability to adjust freq, phase, amplitude and waveform
+ FSM for handling data from SPI and shifting it to correct location
+ Multiple Oscillators
